                    <blockquote class="blockquote">"I’ve always said that the world is a different place for the heartbroken. It moves on a different 
                        axis, at a different speed. Time skips backwards and forwards fleetingly. The heartbroken might go through thousands of 
                        micro-emotions a day trying to figure out how to get through it without picking up the phone to hear that old familiar voice. 
                        In the land of heartbreak, moments of strength, independence, and devil-may-care rebellion are intricately woven together 
                        with grief, paralyzing vulnerability and hopelessness. Imagining your future might always take you on a detour back to the 
                        past. And this is all to say, that the next album I’ll be releasing is my version of Red.
                        <br><br>
                        Musically and lyrically, Red resembled a heartbroken person. It was all over the place, a fractured mosaic of feelings that 
                        somehow all fit together in the end. Happy, free, confused, lonely, devastated, euphoric, wild, and tortured by memories 
                        past. Like trying on pieces of a new life, I went into the studio and experimented with different sounds and collaborators. 
                        And I’m not sure if it was pouring my thoughts into this album, hearing thousands of your voices sing the lyrics back to 
                        me in passionate solidarity, or if it was simply time, but something was healed along the way.
                        <br><br>
                        Sometimes you need to talk it over (over and over and over) for it to ever really be... over. Like your friend who calls you 
                        in the middle of the night going on and on about their ex, I just couldn’t stop writing. This will be the first time you hear 
                        all 30 songs that were meant to go on Red. And hey, one of them is even ten minutes long."</blockquote>
